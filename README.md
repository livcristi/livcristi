## Hi there 👋

My name is Liviu-Cristian Terebeș and I am interested in fun software development and machine learning.

# About Me 🐱‍💻
- I am a Software Engineer at [8x8](https://github.com/8x8) (guess who maintains their AI microservices 👀).

- I try to learn new things every day (whether how to use a new Java framework 🍃 or how to bake the perfect brownie).
